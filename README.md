# Marcomms-START_HERE
A place for everyone, to start contributing to the Marketing team at WordPress.org.
Please visit the [wiki](https://github.com/wpmarketingteam/Marcomms-START_HERE/wiki) for more information. The wiki is being developed, if you could help, let us know through GitHub or on the Marketing channel on the Make WordPress Slack.

Come hang out with us in the #marketing channel on [Slack](http://wordpress.slack.com/messages/marketing/) and (or) join us at our next Weekly Marketing Chat on Wednesdays.

## Getting Involved
There are so many ways to contribute in the team. The weekly Global Marketing Team meeting focuses on the current tasks and the type of skills needed. Once our GitHub boards are more populated, you will be able to view tasks which have different tags, eg core-related, current priority, etc. We are currently moving our main boards to GitHub and incorporating feedback from our testing phase. 

You might join at or after a contributor event held in different cities in the world. These events tend to focus on a number of set tasks aimed at new contributors. We also try to support the events with remote collaboration from other locations on existing tasks. More on this below.

## New Contributor Orientation
We continue to develop resources to help new and returning contributors, as well as those coming to help on specific tasks from other teams.

In 2019, 2020 and 2021, we also worked with WordCamp Europe on materials to help those coming fresh to the WordPress project and a resources area which could be trialled and incoporated into Learn WordPress and other resources.

## Set up a WordPress.org account (multiple languages)
Two of the main things you will need to contribute to WordPress is an account on the Slack account (instant messaging) used by Make WordPress and a WordPress.org identity. We have produced a help video to take you through the steps of setting up a WordPress.org profile and joining the Make WordPress Slack to make it easier to get started. It is available in a number of different languages in this [workshop on Lean WordPress](https://learn.wordpress.org/workshop/set-up-a-wordpress-org-account/).

## Ongoing work on updating the Marketing Team Handbook
This is being amalgamated and can be found in the rolling content repository. (https://github.com/wpmarketingteam/Marcomms-Rolling-tasks/issues/5#issue-977824094).
